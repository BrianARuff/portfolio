            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>
                In Jun of 2017, I discovered computer programming. I started out learning Python, and then switched things up by learning
                about HTML & CSS. I then learned about Ruby on Rails in a boot camp that I attended which was hosted by Tech
                Talent South. Since then, nearly everyday, I have spent 4 hours or more studying different elements of web
                development. I have also attended a course that taught the basics of Android development through a new company
                called TechWorks of Gaston County. Furthermore, I have attended advanced Ruby on Rails and JavaScript classes
                as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know that it may sound cliche, but developing and designing things for the web is truly a passion for me. I do not do this
                for the monetary gains that are potentially involved. My goals are to become a professional developer who
                makes enough money to live a comfortable life and still be happy.

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>I have been a fan of basketball as early as I can remember. I can remember watching Michael Jordan's game winning
                shot to win the 1997-1998 NBA championship. I also played this sport throughout high school and middle school.
                My favorite team is the Chicago Bulls even though they have had some bad years since the Jordan days.</p>

            <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p>
                I have been an avid chess player since middle school (2002). I have played in many different chess tournaments. I even got
                the chance to represent North Carolina in the North Carolina vs South Carolina Border Battle. I left with
                a result 0f 2.5-2.5, so it was a draw on my part. In 8th grade I placed 21st in the NC State Scholastic Championship.

            <h2>World of Warcraft</h2>
            <p>
                I started playing World Of Warcraft on February 27th, 2007,
                one day before my birthday. I have met many people through
                this game and it has been a life changer for me. However,
                these days I focus my efforts on coding, and don't game
                nearly as much as I used to.
