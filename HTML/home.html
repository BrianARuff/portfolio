                attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies

                gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts

                Rails
                is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default
                structures for a database, a web service, and web
                pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards
                such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition
                to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known

                convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself
                (DRY), and the active record pattern.</p>

                React is a framework that I started using in January of 2018.
                Essentially, it is the view in the MVC architecture, though
                it's possible, using arrays and objects, for a React
                developer to create their own model layer, though this is
                typically handled by a backend language such as Ruby on Rails
                or NodeJS. React uses the virtual DOM to compare against the
                real DOM and only makes changes where there are differences.
                This leads to improved performance because touching the DOM
                is very slow, and so for this matter, React replaces a lot of
                what JQuery used to handle, though JQuery is by no means
                obsolete. There are still plenty of work for JQuery to do,
                it's just that it's relevance has been reduced with the
                introduction of ReactJS.
